# Garden 植園
## Intro
This repository was the result of my website practice in 2021 Jan.

It was a group project,and I designed the website layouts and composed the part of product pages.

For this project,we used (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## Install
To open it, you should install:
- [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) 
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) 
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Mongo File
- create one database named "final_project"
- create collections named "members"/"products"/"purchases"
- import the json file (members/products/purchases)

## Check it out

If you have all the prerequisites installed, you should verify if your MongoDB is up.

```
$ cd finalBackend <br>
$ npm i <br>
$ nodemon app.js <br>
```
```
$ cd finalnew <br>
$ npm i <br>
$ yarn start <br>
```
